    "\n",
    "## 1. Objective\n",
    "- Define primary question(s) and success criteria.\n",
    "- List target variable(s) and key stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Sources\n",
    "- Enumerate CSV files and brief description of each.\n",
    "- Record last modified dates, estimated row counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data Inventory\n",
    "- For each CSV: columns, types, sample values, unique counts, nulls.\n",
    "- Identify keys and join columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Global summary statistics (mean/median/std, ranges).\n",
    "- Univariate analysis: distributions, missingness, cardinality.\n",
    "- Bivariate analysis: correlations, group comparisons, pivot tables.\n",
    "- Temporal/spatial checks (if applicable).\n",
    "- Initial visualizations to surface patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Data Cleaning\n",
    "- Missing value strategy (drop/impute/flag) per column.\n",
    "- Duplicate detection and handling.\n",
    "- Type conversions and normalization (dates, categories, numerics).\n",
    "- Outlier detection and treatment plan.\n",
    "- Consistency checks across CSVs after joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Feature Engineering\n",
    "- Derived features (ratios, aggregations, time-based features).\n",
    "- Encoding strategies for categorical variables.\n",
    "- Scaling/normalization considerations.\n",
    "- Feature selection/reduction (correlation, importance, PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Sampling and Split\n",
    "- Train/validation/test split strategy and random seed.\n",
    "- Stratification rules (if class imbalance).\n",
    "- Cross-validation scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Modeling / Analysis Approaches\n",
    "- Baseline models or heuristics.\n",
    "- Candidate models/techniques to try (e.g., regression, tree-based, clustering).\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "- Primary and secondary metrics aligned with objectives (RMSE, MAE, AUC, F1, etc.).\n",
    "- Business-relevant thresholds and error tolerances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Validation and Diagnostics\n",
    "- Cross-validation results and variance checks.\n",
    "- Residual analysis, calibration, and error breakdowns by segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Visualization & Reporting\n",
    "- Key charts for stakeholders (trends, feature importance, performance).\n",
    "- Summary dashboard mockup and export formats (PDF/HTML/Jupyter).\n",
    "- Narrative: findings, limitations, recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Reproducibility & Code Organization\n",
    "- Repo layout, notebook vs script decisions, virtual environment and package list.\n",
    "- Data provenance, random seeds, and runbook for reproducing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. Timeline & Deliverables\n",
    "- Milestones: EDA, cleaning, prototyping, final model, report.\n",
    "- Expected outputs: notebooks, scripts, trained artifacts, report.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. Next Steps / Open Questions\n",
    "- Data gaps, additional data needs, unresolved assumptions.\n",
    "- Potential experiments or deeper analyses.\n",
